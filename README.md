# Traditional-vs-AI-Analysis-LEGO-Dataset
Comparative analysis of LEGO datasets using traditional statistical methods versus AI-driven techniques, showcasing EDA, clustering, and predictive insights.

## Overview

This project compares traditional statistical methods and AI-based techniques to analyze LEGO set data.  
The traditional analysis focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), summary statistics, and visualizations, while the AI-driven analysis (under development) aims to uncover hidden patterns through machine learning models.

---

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Tableau (planned for future dashboards)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Steps (Traditional Analysis)

- Data Cleaning and Normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of yearly LEGO set releases and popular themes
- Price vs Pieces Scatter Plot Analysis
- Summary Statistics Extraction

---

## Future Steps (AI Analysis - Extension Plan)

- Clustering LEGO Sets based on features
- Predictive Modeling of LEGO Set Pricing
- Feature Engineering (Theme, Piece Count, Age Range)
- AI-Driven Segmentation and Recommendation Engine

---

## Key Insights (Traditional Analysis)

- LEGO set production has grown steadily from 1970 to 2022, with a major boom after 2000.
- Top themes include Star Wars, City, and Creator, accounting for a major portion of releases.
- LEGO set prices correlate moderately with the number of pieces, though there are notable exceptions.
- Median price for most LEGO sets is ~$20, with luxury sets skewing the mean upwards.

---

## Summary

The traditional analysis highlights valuable patterns in LEGO datasets using simple statistical techniques.  
Further AI-driven analysis will enhance pattern discovery, clustering, and predictive capabilities.
